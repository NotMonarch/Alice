# Alice — Game Bot

> "Alice runs a social deduction game where all players receive the same real question, except for one randomly chosen Imposter who receives a different question. Players answer privately, then vote to identify the Imposter based on the answers revealed anonymously."

Alice is a production-ready Telegram bot built with Python, designed for group chats. It features seamless DM integration, anonymous voting, and persistent leaderboards.
